Motion Detection and Webcam Testing with Python
This project consists of Python scripts for motion detection using OpenCV and testing your webcam. It includes the following files:

Files and Descriptions
1. motion_detection.py
This script detects motion using your computer's webcam and OpenCV. It captures video, identifies changes between frames, and highlights areas with motion. Features include:

Motion detection and visualization.
Recording video when motion is detected.
Timestamps on the video feed.
Press 'q' to exit the application.

2. check_webcam.py
    This script checks if your webcam is working correctly. It opens the webcam stream and displays the video feed. Features include:

Testing your webcam functionality.
Press 'q' to exit the webcam test.
3. main.py
This is a simple Python script generated by PyCharm. It's not directly related to the motion detection or webcam testing functionality and can be removed or modified as needed.

**Getting Started**

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You may need to install OpenCV using pip if it's not already installed.
3. Run the desired script:

To test your webcam, run check_webcam.py.
To detect motion using your webcam, run motion_detection.py.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions for each script.

Notes
The output.avi file mentioned in motion_detection.py is used to save the recorded video when motion is detected.
If you do not need to save the video, you can comment out or remove the relevant lines of code.
